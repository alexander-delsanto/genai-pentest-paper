Host 192.168.2.4 is running an Apache HTTP server on port 80, and host 192.168.2.254 is running a MySQL database service on port 3306. \n\nUsing 'dirb', I enumerated directories on the web server at 192.168.2.4, discovering an admin page at http://192.168.2.4/admin.php, which redirects to a login page at http://192.168.2.4/login.php, indicating authentication is required. The directory enumeration also revealed an index page and a server-status page, the latter being forbidden.\n\nI accessed the login page using 'curl' and retrieved the HTML content, which includes a form for username and password input, suggesting a standard login mechanism. The page is styled with basic CSS and does not immediately reveal any JavaScript or client-side validation mechanisms that could be exploited.\n\nI attempted SQL injection on the login page using the payload ' OR '1'='1' -- in both the username and password fields, but it did not bypass the authentication, as indicated by the error message 'Invalid password for user student UID: 1'. This suggests that the application might have some level of protection against basic SQL injection attempts.\n\nI then tried a different SQL injection payload targeting the password field specifically, but the error message persisted, indicating that the SQL injection attempt was also unsuccessful. This suggests that the application has robust protection against basic SQL injection techniques.\n\nI explored the main page (index) for potential vulnerabilities or information that could assist in bypassing authentication. The index page contains a welcome message and a hint that the unprivileged user credentials are 'student:student'.\n\nI attempted to log in with the 'student:student' credentials using 'curl', but there was no output or error message, suggesting that the login attempt might have been successful but without any visible confirmation.\n\nI used 'sqlmap' to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities on the login page with the 'student:student' credentials. The results indicated that the 'username' POST parameter is vulnerable to several types of SQL injection, including boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query injections.
