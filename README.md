# Benchmarking Generative Agents for Penetration Testing

This repo contains the codes for reproducing the experiments of the paper [AutoPenBench: Benchmarking Generative Agents for Penetration Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03225). 

We are currently cleaning and documenting the codes. The process will take approximately one week. 
If are interested, please write a mail to [Luca Gioacchini](mailto:luca.gioacchini@polito.it?subject=[GitHub]%20Pentest%20Codes%20Notification) to be notified as soon we will upload them.

# ToDo
- Add documentation in this README
- Notebook folder for aggregating results
