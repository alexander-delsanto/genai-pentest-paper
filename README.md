# Benchmarking Generative Agents for Penetration Testing

This repo contains the codes for the experiments of the paper [AutoPenBench: Benchmarking Generative Agents for Penetration Testing](#tbd). 

We are currently cleaning and documenting the codes. The process will take approximately one week. 
If are interested, please write a mail to [Luca Gioacchini](mailto:luca.gioacchini@polito.it?subject=[GitHub]%20Pentest%20Codes%20Notification) to be notified as soon we will upload them.
