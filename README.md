# Benchmarking Generative Agents for Penetration Testing

This repo contains the codes for reproducing the experiments of the paper [AutoPenBench: Benchmarking Generative Agents for Penetration Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03225). 

**Note** if you need the AutoPenBench source code, visit the [official repository](https://github.com/lucagioacchini/auto-pen-bench).

## How to Reproduce the Experiments
1. Firstly ensure that you have `cmake` installed on your local machine. Open a terminal and run
```bash
cmake --version
```

If you need to install it, open a terminal and run
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake
```

2. Now create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required libraries, the benchmarking framework [AgentQuest](https://github.com/nec-research/agentquest) and the [AutoPenBench](https://github.com/lucagioacchini/auto-pen-bench) benchmark by running

```bash
./setup.sh
```

4. To reproduce the experiments of the paper, simply open a terminal upon installation and virtual environment activation, then type:

```bash
python3 experiments/EXPERIMENT_FOLDER/EXPERIMENT_FILE
```

where `EXPERIMENT_FOLDER` identifies the type of experiments (e.g. `00-model_selection` or `01-autonomous_agent`) and `EXPERIMENT_FILE` identifies the experiment to run (e.g. `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` for `model_selection` or `access_control` for `01-autonomous_agent`).

## Structure of This Repo

- the [`experiments`](./experiments/) folder contains the source codes of the experiments of the paper
- the [`logs`](./logs/) folder contains the raw experimental results which are processed in [this notebook](./experiments/04-notebooks/results.ipynb)
- the [`genai`](./genai/) folder contains the well documented source codes of the generative agents cognitive architectures we designed and implemented in the paper
- th [`examples`](./examples/) folders contains a couple of notebooks showing how to make the [autonomous](./examples/autonomous_agent.ipynb) and [assisted](./examples/assisted_agent.ipynb) agents interact with the benchmark
